Repo of Portfolio Site for JS Premier Web Solutions

## Synopsis

This is the portfolio website for **JS Premier Web Solutions**.

## Motivation

This site serves as an advertisement for my website creation services. The biggest feature of the site itself is its responsive design. This is an attempt to show perspective clients their websites will also follow a responsive design. Perspective clients can reach me via the Contact link.

## Installation

Since this is a Drupal 7 site, only the /sites folder is contained in this GitHub repository. This repository would have to be combined with a default install of Drupal 7 and a dump of the database in order to replecate the site. The GitHub repository is located at: https://github.com/jlslaughter9398/portfolio1.git.

## API Reference

The site was written in Drupal 7.
